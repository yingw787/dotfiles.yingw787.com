This site literally just exists to host my dotfiles. Originally because I
couldn't figure out how to configure HTTP response header
`"Content-Disposition"` for file type `file/x-sh` on AWS S3 (which I believe is
more an issue with the browser you are using), now mostly because I made [a
pretty theme](https://github.com/yingw787/hugo-theme-carrd50) and I like
webpages more than shell scripts for default subdomain routes.

Feel free to check out the git repository for my dotfiles (also referenced in
the setup script) at https://github.com/yingw787/dotfiles and take a look at the
README there.

Inspired by https://dotfiles.github.io.
